1. Noticed instructions specify a "functional programming style" must be used 

	- No idea what functional programming is 
	- Did some research on functional programming and found this article https://shorturl.at/cdX69
		* Concepts: 
			- A different method of programming, compared to OOP (Object oriented programming) 
			- OOP uses mutable data, FP uses immutable data (data which cannot be altered, 
			must make a copy of the variable that you want to change)
			- OOP uses the imperative programming model (functions are invariably coded in every step needed to solve 
			a problem, programmer must know what functions are necessary to solve a problem, rather than relying on 
			models that can solve the problems) Imperative programs focus on the step-by-step process of solving a 
			problem  
			- FP uses declarative programming model, meaning it relies on underlying concepts of a programming languge 
			to execute necessary steps to reach the predetermined outcome. Declarative programs focus on the 
			result of solving a problem  

	- Researched some languages that use this style of programming 
	- Found Haskell, then I found this tutorial https://serokell.io/blog/rust-for-haskellers
	- Now I have a clearer idea of Functional Programming 
	- Time to start implementing each step 
		- **first I implemented the main function using existing Rust knowledge 
		- used ChatGPT as assistance for the pair input as I ran into a slight issue  
		* Step 1: 
			- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reflexive-relations/
			- Determining if a relation is reflexive: check if every element in the set is related to itself 
			- OOP Method: if for every method a in the set, the pair (a,a) is in the relation, then the relation 
			is reflexive (return true) 
			- https://codeburst.io/a-beginner-friendly-intro-to-functional-programming-4f69aa109569 (starting
			with the function) 		
			- implemented basic input using prior Rust knowledge 
			- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reflexive-relation-on-set/ (for our reflexive function) 
			- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66386013/how-to-iterate-over-two-elements-in-a-collection-stepping-by-one-using-iterator
		* Step 2: 
			- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/symmetric-relation-on-a-set/
			- Determining if a relation is symmetric: if an ordered pair of elements “a” to “b” (aRb) 
			is present in relation R, then an ordered pair of elements “b” to “a” (bRa) 
			should also be present in relation R.
